# Hi, I'm Joe

I'm run a [**YouTube Channel called "Matching Brackets**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9KuKnzAuVFbfd8W3kKzO1g)," and there, I talk about Linux from a beginner's point of view, front end web development, and teaching people about the dangers of online scammers. 
- Linux from a beginner's point of view.
