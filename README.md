# Hi, I'm Joe

I run a YouTube Channel called [**"Matching Brackets,"**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9KuKnzAuVFbfd8W3kKzO1g) and there, I talk about...
- 🐧 Linux from a beginner's point of view.
- 💻 front end web developent and web site making.
- 👺 teaching people about the dangers of online scammers.
- 👍 I also like to talk about Gen X, and how it used to be in the olden days.
